# How this works

This library is designed to make your life really easy, so this needs to be super-clear or it will be self-defeating.

1. Clone this repo
2. Start a repl
3. Type `(page "code")`.

Open `index.html` and your code will be live!

# Why I made this

My favorite way to write Clojure code is in KLIPSE snippets, because the code is being constantly evaluated with the current result being displayed while you are editing it. **This is super useful!**

But then... in order to save your work, you need to go into your html and paste in your snippet, which gets annoying. I think this makes it slightly less so.
